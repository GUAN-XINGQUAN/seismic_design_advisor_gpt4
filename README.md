# Seismic Design Advisor-GPT4

This project integrates the large language model with the [AutoSDA platform](https://github.com/GUAN-XINGQUAN/AutoSDAPlatform) to facilitate the seismic design process.

The front-end is a chatting rebot that guides users to collect necessary design variables.

The back-end is the AutoSDA platform to automate the seismic design process, whose design outcome is returned to the front-end.
